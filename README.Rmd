# CleaningProject


This is a repository for the Project required for Getting and Cleaning Data classes by Coursera in July 2014. 

Purpose of the project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Apart from this very file and the README.md, the repository contains:

1. run_analysis.R; the script performing data cleaning  
2. CodeBookd.md; a codebook describing columns of the created tidy dataset 

and irrelevant for the reviewing, but important for me:
* Lab.R: experiments and notes necessary to produce run_analysis.R
